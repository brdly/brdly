<h3 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹<br>I'm George</h3>
<h4 align="center">(He/They)</h4>

<p align="center">
I'm a Full Stack Web Developer from Salford.

I currently work for Skylab whom I joined in November 2021 and have worked with some awesome clients using a mix of vanilla JavaScript, VueJS and AlpineJS alongside backend coding using PHP with Laravel.

I started learning to program in 2008 during high school with VB.NET before moving onto some C#.NET and then PHP where I realised that web development was what I enjoyed.

I dabble in some design work in my free time and always willing to learn something new.
